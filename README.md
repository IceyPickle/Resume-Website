# Resume-Website
Description: This is for me to create my website and present myself on here. My goal is to include my resume, some tabs, and make it look fancy to display for future job interview or job sight. I am a graduated computer science major and a minor in math. The coding language I will try to learn is HTML, CSS, and SQL. I plan to grow my coding language skills and be open to learn more.

This is my website to create about myself: 12-23-24
